A few days ago, I was conversing with my friend and suggested taking the equity route for long-term wealth creation. I asked him to trust in the India growth story and stay invested, explaining the return on investment (ROI) achieved in  the last fiscal year. For instance, the NIFTY 50 has yielded approximately a **23.58%** ROI in FY 23-24.  [ROI Calculator](https://cleartax.in/s/roi-return-on-investment-calculator)

![NIFTY 50 (FY 23-24)](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/viXELD44DIHNQsGQxAXWFxsDwaG6hf2e40C1kFo1T9j0E4mjHIjFw2aaYry5t_yGFs0vJcDACRIXJxxUxsidkwAqV9On0dsFv-FDfqpYD9caJ3L5dsqJViJ8EIJs0kUsTAt_4kKE9CC-P6ownsaoj9U)

                                              **NIFTY 50 Returns, FY 23-24**

  
The next question that popped up was: what makes me bullish about the Indian economy and its growth prospects, especially considering the challenges posed by the [global economic slowdown](https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/economy/2022/07/26/imf-cuts-global-growth-on-gloomy-outlook-of-ukraine-war-china-slowdown-and-inflation/)? I provided my friend with some answers based on my conviction, but upon reflection, I realized that I wasn't entirely certain about the basis of this conviction, particularly given the changes seen in the post-COVID-19 era

This led me to decide to dig deeper into understanding the source of my conviction. In this blog, I attempt to explain why we should all be bullish on India's growth story_. Please don’t consider this blog as financial advice or a_ _recommendation; it's simply my perspective on our country and its economic growth prospects, utilizing data points_  _retrieved from publicly available information._

India GDP Growth Story
----------------------

India has recently become the [most populous country](https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion/feedback/2022/11/18/population-growth-is-a-double-edged-sword/) in the world, surpassing China. However, this achievement  doesn't fill me with pride. In fact, it brings to light a sobering reality: _despite our ascent toward becoming a top-renowned global economy, our_  _GDP per capita is likely to lag for a considerable time_. Other emerging economies, which are outperforming us, may 

see quicker results.

                                              **India Population Growth (10yrs)** 

  

However, our population is our dividend and **drives the economy domestically based on consumption and young** **working-age population aspirations**. Because of this reason, it’s very difficult for our country to go into recession. As per the [statista data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263771/gross-domestic-product-gdp-in-india/), India's GDP was around **2.84 trillion** U.S. dollars, and now we have reached **3.42 trillion** U.S. dollars.  Manufacturing and Services sector contributes approximately 74% and may go up to 78%/.

                                           **India GDP growth in trillions of dollars**

  

Based on some research, it appears that [S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/en/research-insights/featured/special-editorial/look-forward/india-s-future-the-quest-for-high-and-stable-growth#:~:text=We%20expect%20India%20to%20grow%206.7%25%20per%20year,a%2010-year%20high%20of%2034%25%20in%20fiscal%202023.) is anticipating Indian GDP to grow at **6.7% per year fiscal 2024 to** **fiscal 2031**, catapulting GDP to **$6.7 trillion** from $3.4 trillion. Per capita GDP will rise to about **$4,500**. The [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/263771/gross-domestic-product-gdp-in-india/) data confirm the same projection.

Indian Economy Resiliency
-------------------------

In the earlier section, we discussed why we believe the Indian economy is poised for better performance in the next decade. However, there are scenarios that could potentially impact this growth forecast. Therefore, it's crucial to draw some conclusions based on historical GDP growth (%) data. 

The only instance when our economy experienced a recession for a year was during the **COVID-19** pandemic. However, India has managed to shield itself from the knee-jerk reactions caused by global financial meltdowns.

Indian Foreign Exchange Reserves
--------------------------------

We have one of the largest USD reserves in the world. This is growing at a significant rate. This helps to cushion against external shocks, provides fiscal impetus to drive economic growth, and also reflects improvements in the balance of payments regarding exports and imports.

Foreign Direct Investments
--------------------------

A massive domestic market, coupled with steadily improving global competitiveness, is facilitating India's attraction  of [foreign investment](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/explainers/fdi-in-india-inflows/89609/1). This assertion is not made by me, but by S&P. The country boasts one of the largest domestic markets worldwide, and its growth trajectory is positioned to outpace that of most other emerging nations. This  implies that India has political stability and the economic ability to outperform its peers. To know more about the fact, read this [article.](https://www.statista.com/topics/5560/fdi-in-india/#topicOverview)

India's inclusion in GBI-EM index
---------------------------------

According to some reports, the **Indian government bond market ranks as the third largest** among emerging economies, following China and Brazil. However, foreign ownership currently stands at less than 2%, which is among the lowest compared to other emerging markets. The inclusion of India in the J.P. Morgan GBI-EM index by June 28, 2024, will not only help India raise more funds and integrate its economy with the global economy but also expand the investor base for government securities. Check the report [here](https://www.investindia.gov.in/team-india-blogs/indias-inclusion-jp-morgans-government-bond-index-emerging-markets-gbi-em-index#:~:text=The%20announcement%20of%20India%27s%20inclusion,importance%20in%20the%20world%20economy). 

  

India’s inclusion in Bloomberg (EM) Local Currency Government Index
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Indian FAR bonds will be included in the Bloomberg EM Local Currency Government indices with an initial weight of  10% of their full market value on January 31, 2025. Check the report [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/company/press/bloomberg-announces-india-far-bonds-inclusion-in-the-bloomberg-emerging-market-em-local-currency-government-index/#:~:text=Bloomberg%20today%20announced%20inclusion%20of,%2C%20starting%20January%2031%2C%202025).

Conclusion
----------

After conducting this data analysis, I am certain that now is the time to invest in Indian markets for long-term wealth creation. The equity and debt markets serve as barometers of economic growth, and I firmly believe in India's growth story and expect it to continue. 

No one likes high Inflation, but it’s a reality of today's world, but I expect it to on the higher side, above RBI's comfort zone. Always look at [India Consumer Price Index (CPI) YoY](https://in.investing.com/economic-calendar/indian-cpi-973) to get the real-time data. 

![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/gSNOrRaX7xw9AceKELyifYXyjfx3n4EHIq02HGOT11sOkQi84avQKu2ZJhdW9nomYkLna-CqpWdmPhR1buB3lnu---M3Mb1HWwLob0EXw2SViHIzXZ3sqhcC91P_F0Z3zWpMni0kilS8VzTGj56ed4k)

  

The **Real GDP + Inflation data** gives us the **Nominal GDP growth** rate.  This will not be an accurate correlation but can give us an inference.  Let’s take a look at the following table. 

Equity market returns tend to be correlated with **Nominal GDP growth rate + Dividends Reinvested** in the longer run, but it’s not linear. This idea is based on the premise that economic growth drives corporate profits, which in turn influence stock market returns. 

However, the relationship isn't always perfect as other factors like **Global events, Black Swan Events, Country-specific downturns** and **Investors sentiments** can influence equity markets.  There are some outliers too like companies operating globally and not tied to a single country's GDP growth or **Valuation changes**. Read this [article](https://wealthdesk.in/blog/stock-market-crashes/) to know more events that rocked the stock market. 

Let’s take a look at the following table, and understand this relationship, for instance, with [NIFTY 50](https://primeinvestor.in/nifty-50-returns/) return.

**Read this research paper to learn more about this;** [**Is There a Link Between GDP Growth and Equity Returns?**](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/a134c5d5-dca0-420d-875d-06adb948f578)

### **Learning** 

Indian Economy has shown remarkable growth and expected to grow in coming year. Global Events may temporarily disrupt the growth, but due to strong domestic factors, the country is not likely to go into recession. We can expect the markets to make minimum returns equivalent to Nominal GDP growth rate + Dividends Reinvested, in the longer run. 

I am prepared to bet on the economy and its potential for significant returns. Armed with data, I am confident to presenting my points to my friend.

Cheers !!
